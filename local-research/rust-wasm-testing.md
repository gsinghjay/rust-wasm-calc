Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: rust wasm testing best practices and patterns
Here are some best practices and patterns for testing Rust WebAssembly code:

1. Use wasm-pack for testing Rust WASM projects[2]. It provides the `wasm-pack test` command to run tests in a WebAssembly environment.

2. Write unit tests directly in your Rust code using the #[cfg(test)] attribute[3]. For example:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
    }
}
```

3. For integration testing, use frameworks like Jest with Puppeteer or Playwright to load WASM modules in a browser and run automated tests[3].

4. Perform performance testing using JavaScript's performance APIs to measure WASM function execution time[3]:

```javascript
const start = performance.now();
const result = wasmModule.exports.yourFunction();
const end = performance.now();
console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} milliseconds`);
```

5. Implement security testing using fuzz testing tools like American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) to find edge cases and vulnerabilities[3].

6. Set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions or similar to automate testing on every commit[3].

7. Use the `#![no_std]` attribute and `extern crate std;` pattern for optionally std-compatible crates[4]:

```rust
#![no_std]

#[cfg(feature = "std")]
extern crate std;
```

8. Test no_std builds on targets without std like thumbv7em-none-eabi to ensure true no_std compatibility[4].

9. Use web-time instead of instant for a std::time::Instant substitute in WASM[4].

10. Avoid using wee_alloc as it's unmaintained. The default allocator is generally sufficient for WASM[4].
